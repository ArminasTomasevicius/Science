Nucleus -> ribosomes
Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum -> has ribosomes and produce proteins
Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum -> produce lipids to detoxify toxins

Golgi apporatus -> from RER proteins travel to golgi -> packaging -> secreted in secretory vesicles

Ribosomes dont have membranes

RER proteins go outside or to the membrane, Free ribosomes proteins stay in citoplasm.

Lysosomes - special vesicles that contain hydrolitic enzymes, inside of it pH=5s

Peroxisome - vesicles that create H2O2 to detoxicate, a lot of them in liver

Centrioles - help to separate cell

Glysosomes - find in plants digest lipids to sugars
